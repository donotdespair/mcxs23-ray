However, fiscal policy shocks often occur in multifaceted ways, with simultaneous changes in both revenue and expenditure-side elements of the fiscal balance, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of any one particular policy.\nThis study attempts to identify the effect of the following fiscal policy instruments: tax policy, public investment expenditures, and social transfers, on both unemployment and output in the Australian context, using Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (BSVAR) approach.\nThe analysis is guided by the work of Abubakar, Attahir B. (2016), which used a SVAR approach to estimate the effect of public expenditures and public revenues on Nigerian output and unemployment. This study extends this work by using a more extensive dataset, involving more disaggregated revenue and expenditure variables, the inclusion of monetary policy control variables, as well as through the use of Bayesian estimation."
